# What's this guide?

While studying for the 3 AWS Associate level certifications I have taken notes in markdown format.  
This is because to remember things I have to write them down, producing short summaries of the information I am reading. This is the only method that works for me.  
I later realized that this content, in addition to being a support to me as a refresher before the exams, might also be useful to others, so I decided to publish it on my blog.  
I think that it could be used as an additional study source, as a refeesher, or even as an introduction for some AWS topics that you are approaching.  
I don't know if someone will ever find it useful, anyway, here it is.

# Disclaimer
I am trying to keep everything updated, but the cloud runs fast, and I cannot assure that something has changed recently. If you notice something outdated please notify it to me.

# Another little disclaimer
This piece of documentation is not meant in any way to be a complete and structured guide.
The idea was just to write down the fundamental information, mainy as bullet points. Obviously I noted what I thought was not easy to remember, and what I didn't already know. So it's clear that these notes are partially tailored on me and on my needs.  
Anyway, I hope that someone will benefit in some way from them.

# And a little last disclaimer
I studied on many different books, online resources and videos, and may be that some sentences are simply a copy&paste from somewhere. It's not my intention to steal any intellectual property, so if you think that any part of this guide represents any kind of violation, p!ease send me a message and I will be happy to mention the source or remove the content.
