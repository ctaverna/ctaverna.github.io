# IoT Core

It's simply the Amazon's MQTT broker, almost-standard, with some limit.

Port is not standard and encryption is mandatory.

* ALPN Protocol
* Recently, loading your protocols it is possible to call the MQTT broker using your custom domain name
* Logs can be sent to CloudWatch
* Events can be used as triggers for publications
* The client MUST have a client certificate
