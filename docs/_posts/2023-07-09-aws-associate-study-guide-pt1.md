While studying for the 3 AWS Associate level certifications I started taking notes in markdown format.

This is because to remember things I have to write them down, producing short summaries of the information I am reading. And this is the only method that works for me.  
I later realized that this **recap content**, in addition to being a support to me as a refresher before the exams, might also be useful to others, so I decided to publish it on my blog.

I think and hope that it could be used as an additional study source, as a refresher, or even as a super-fast introduction to some AWS topics that you are approaching.

I will release them gradually over the coming weeks, after a small review.
