While studying for the 3 AWS Associate level certifications I started taking notes in markdown format.

This is because to remember things I have to write them down, producing short summaries of the information I am reading. And this is the only method that works for me.  
I later realized that this **recap content**, in addition to being a support to me as a refresher before the exams, might also be useful to others, so I decided to publish it on my blog.
I think and hope that it could be used as an additional study source, as a refresher, or even as a super-fast introduction to some AWS topics that you are approaching.

I will release the content gradually **over the coming weeks**, after a small review.  
The content of the three exams is different, but there is a lot of overlap, and a general overview can be useful in any case, if you are studying for [AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/), [AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/) or [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/).
In the end, I will also share a table with a matrix to better understand what are the services on which each exam is focused.

This is the content that comes with **Part 1**, released today:

I will also release a collection of the most interesting **sample exam questions** that I have come across while studying and practicing.
