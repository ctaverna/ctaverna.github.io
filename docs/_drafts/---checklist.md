# Headline
- Stories with **8 to 14-word** headlines get more social media shares (HubSpot analyzed 6,000 blog posts)
- 80 characters or fewer, otherwise the title will get truncated in news feeds on Facebook and Twitter

# Incipit
The reader is looking for an excuse to jump back. 
The text should start making points and telling a story immediately.
Establish the writer’s credibility within the first few paragraphs.
Reinforce the writer’s credibility throughout the story. They should support their arguments with data.

# General
People prefer short paragraphs to walls of text.
There’s nothing wrong with single-sentence paragraphs.

Use “for example” instead of “E.G.”
Use “that is” instead of “I.E.”
Use “note that” instead of “N.B.”

The only place for semicolons in this world is at the end of a line of code.

Front-end development (adjective form with a dash) is when you’re working on the front end (noun form with no dash).
The same goes with the back end, full stack, and many other compound terms.

# Abbreviations
If an abbreviation isn’t already widely understood, and you’re going to refer to it more than a few times, you can define it as an abbreviation by doing this:
“Let’s break the code down into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).”
Avoid defining an abbreviation in your opening paragraphs, as it slows your reader down and makes them less likely to continue reading.


# Gatekeeping
A lot of times, writers don’t realize they’re gatekeeping. Here are some expressions they may use:

obviously
simply [do something]
of course [something is such-and-such]
as everyone knows
as you’ve probably heard
[something] is easy
any [“idiot”, “fool”, “newbie”, “script kiddie”, etc.] can [do something]
If you see gatekeeping, just remove it. Most of these expressions don’t actually add anything to the article.
